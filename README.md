# NLP-Preprocessing-And-Text-Classification
Lab Assignment No. 4- NLP Preprocessing And Text Classificationsing)


## 1. Objective
This assignment focuses on applying various Natural Language Processing (NLP) preprocessing techniques followed by building a text classification model using traditional machine learning algorithms.

## 2. Problem Definition
- **Dataset**: A collection of labeled text samples.
- **Task**: Perform preprocessing and classify the text into predefined categories.
- **Approach**: Use standard NLP techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF) followed by training a machine learning model such as Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes.

## 3. Methodology

### NLP Preprocessing Steps
- Convert text to lowercase
- Remove special characters and punctuation
- Remove stopwords
- Tokenization
- Stemming or Lemmatization

### Feature Extraction
- Use TF-IDF or CountVectorizer to convert text into numerical vectors

### Classification
- Train a classifier such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Evaluation
- Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix and classification report

## 4. Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- NLTK / spaCy  
- scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 5. Results
- Preprocessing successfully applied to all text samples
- Classifier achieved good accuracy on test data
- Evaluation metrics and confusion matrix visualized
