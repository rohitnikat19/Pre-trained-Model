# Neural Network from Scratch

## Overview

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing core components of a neural network using NumPy. It includes fundamental concepts such as activation functions, forward propagation, backpropagation, and basic network trainingâ€”all from scratch, without high-level deep learning libraries.

## Features

- Implementation of the **Sigmoid** activation function.
- Derivation and computation of the **Sigmoid derivative**.
- Forward and backward propagation routines.
- Manual weight updates using gradient descent.
- Basic end-to-end neural network training logic.
- Educational focus for understanding how neural networks work internally.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or above
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

## Installation

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy jupyter
